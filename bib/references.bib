  abstract={Design and control of vector fields is critical for many visualization and graphics tasks such as vector field visualization, fluid
simulation, and texture synthesis. The fundamental qualitative structures associated with vector fields are fixed points, periodic orbits,
and separatrices. In this paper, we provide a new technique that allows for the systematic creation and cancellation of fixed points and
periodic orbits. This technique enables vector field design and editing on the plane and surfaces with desired qualitative properties. The
technique is based on Conley theory, which provides a unified framework that supports the cancellation of fixed points and periodic
orbits. We also introduce a novel periodic orbit extraction and visualization algorithm that detects, for the first time, periodic orbits on
surfaces. Furthermore, we describe the application of our periodic orbit detection and vector field simplification algorithms to engine
simulation data demonstrating the utility of the approach. We apply our design system to vector field visualization by creating data sets
containing periodic orbits. This helps us understand the effectiveness of existing visualization techniques. Finally, we propose a new
streamline-based technique that allows vector field topology to be easily identified.},

  abstract={In visualization, we use the terms data, information and knowledge extensively, often in an interrelated context. In many cases, they indicate different levels of abstraction, understanding, or truthfulness. For example, "visualization is concerned with exploring data and information," "the primary objective in data visualization is to gain insight into an information space," and "information visualization" is for "data mining and knowledge discovery." In other cases, these three terms indicate data types, for instance, as adjectives in noun phrases, such as data visualization, information visualization, and knowledge visualization. These examples suggest that data, information, and knowledge could serve as both the input and output of a visualization process, raising questions about their exact role in visualization.},

  abstract={With the rapid evolution of finance technology (FinTech) the importance of analyzing financial transactions is growing in
importance. As the prevalence and number financial transactions grows, so does the necessity of visual analysis tools to study
the behavior represented by these transactions. However, real bank transaction data is generally private due to security and
confidentiality reasons thus preventing its use for visual analysis and research. We present MoneyData, an anonymized open
bank data set spanning seven years worth of transactions for research and analysis purposes. To our knowledge, this is the first
real-world, retail, bank transaction data that has been anonymized and made public for visualization and analysis by other
researchers. We describe the data set, it’s characteristics, the anonymization process, and present some preliminary analysis
and images as a starting point for future research. The transactions are also categorized to facilitate understanding. We believe
the availability of this open data will be of great benefit to the research community and facilitate further study of finance.

  keywords={type: Parallel Coordinates, Angular Histogram, Attribute Curves},
  abstract={Parallel coordinates is a popular and well-known multivariate data visualization technique. However, one of their inherent
limitations has to do with the rendering of very large data sets. This often causes an overplotting problem and the goal of the visual
information seeking mantra is hampered because of a cluttered overview and non-interactive update rates. In this paper, we propose
two novel solutions, namely, angular histograms and attribute curves. These techniques are frequency-based approaches to large,
high-dimensional data visualization. They are able to convey both the density of underlying polylines and their slopes. Angular
histogram and attribute curves offer an intuitive way for the user to explore the clustering, linear correlations and outliers in large data
sets without the over-plotting and clutter problems associated with traditional parallel coordinates. We demonstrate the results on
a wide variety of data sets including real-world, high-dimensional biological data. Finally, we compare our methods with the other
popular frequency-based algorithms},

as reading news online becomes increasingly commonplace. While textual tools have dominated these developments, annotated information visualizations are a promising
way to complement articles based on their ability to add
context. But the manual effort required for professional
designers to create thoughtful annotations for contextualizing news visualizations is difficult to scale. We describe the
design of Contextifier, a novel system that automatically
produces custom, annotated visualizations of stock behavior
given a news article about a company. Contextifier’s algorithms for choosing annotations is informed by a study of
professionally created visualizations and takes into account
visual salience, contextual relevance, and a detection of key
events in the company’s history. In evaluating our system
we find that Contextifier better balances graphical salience
and relevance than the baseline.},

  abstract={Visualization, a vibrant field for researchers, practitioners, and higher educational institutions, is growing and evolving
very rapidly. Tremendous progress has been made since 1987, the year often cited as the beginning of data visualization
as a distinct field. As such, the number of visualization resources and the demand for those resources is increasing
at a rapid pace. After a decades-equivalent long search process, we present a survey of open visualization resources
for all those with an interest in interactive data visualization and visual analytics. Because the number of resources
is so large, we focus on collections of resources, of which there are already many ranging from literature collections
to collections of practitioner resources. Based on this, we develop a classification of visualization resource collections
with a focus on the resource type, e.g. literature-based, web-based, developer focused and special topics. The result
is an overview and details-on-demand of many useful resources. The collection offers a valuable jump-start for those
seeking out data visualization resources from all backgrounds spanning from beginners such as students to teachers,
practitioners, developers and researchers wishing to create their own advanced or novel visual designs. This paper is
a response to students and others who frequently ask for visualization resources available to them.

  abstract={Information visualization as a field is growing rapidly in popularity since the first information visualization conference in 1995.
However, as a consequence of its growth, it is increasingly difficult to follow the growing body of literature within the field.
Survey papers and literature reviews are valuable tools for managing the great volume of previously published research papers,
and the quantity of survey papers in visualization has reached a critical mass. To this end, this survey paper takes a quantum
step forward by surveying and classifying literature survey papers in order to help researchers understand the current landscape
of Information Visualization. It is, to our knowledge, the first survey of survey papers (SoS) in Information Visualization. This
paper classifies survey papers into natural topic clusters which enables readers to find relevant literature and develops the
first classification of classifications. The paper also enables researchers to identify both mature and less developed research
directions as well as identify future directions. It is a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers in and
outside the field of Information Visualization and Visual Analytics.

To keep abreast of the latest developments in the domain, survey papers and state-of-the-art reviews provide valuable tools
for managing the large quantity of scientific literature. Recently, a survey of survey papers was published to keep track of the
quantity of refereed survey papers in information visualization conferences and journals. However, no such resources exist
to inform readers of the large volume of books being published on the subject, leaving the possibility of valuable knowledge
being overlooked. We present the first literature survey of information visualization books that addresses this challenge by
surveying the large volume of books on the topic of information visualization and visual analytics. This unique survey addresses
some special challenges associated with collections of books (as opposed to research papers) including searching, browsing
and cost. This paper features a novel two-level classification based on both books and chapter topics examined in each book,
enabling the reader to quickly identify to what depth a topic of interest is covered within a particular book. Readers can use this
survey to identify the most relevant book for their needs amongst a quickly expanding collection. In indexing the landscape of

  abstract={A rapidly increasing number of businesses rely on visualisation solutions for their data
management challenges. This demand stems from an industry-wide shift towards data-driven
approaches to decision making and problem-solving. However, there is an overwhelming mass of
heterogeneous data collected as a result. The analysis of these data become a critical and challenging
part of the business process. Employing visual analysis increases data comprehension thus enabling
a wider range of users to interpret the underlying behaviour, as opposed to skilled but expensive
data analysts. Widening the reach to an audience with a broader range of backgrounds creates new
opportunities for decision making, problem-solving, trend identification, and creative thinking. In this
survey, we identify trends in business visualisation and visual analytic literature where visualisation
is used to address data challenges and identify areas in which industries use visual design to develop
their understanding of the business environment. Our novel classification of literature includes
the topics of businesses intelligence, business ecosystem, customer-centric. This survey provides a
valuable overview and insight into the business visualisation literature with a novel classification
that highlights both mature and less developed research directions.},

  abstract={Mutual funds are becoming increasingly popular with the emergence of Internet finance. Clear profiling of a fund’s investment
style is crucial for fund managers to evaluate their investment strategies, and for investors to understand their investment. However, it is challenging to profile a fund’s investment style as it requires a comprehensive analysis of complex multi-dimensional
temporal data. In addition, different fund managers and investors have different focuses when analysing a fund’s investment style.
To address the issue, we propose iFUNDit, an interactive visual analytic system for fund investment style analysis. The system
decomposes a fund’s critical features into performance attributes and investment style factors, and visualizes them in a set of
coupled views: a fund and manager view, to delineate the distribution of funds’ and managers’ critical attributes on the market;
a cluster view, to show the similarity of investment styles between different funds; and a detail view, to analyse the evolution of
fund investment style. The system provides a holistic overview of fund data and facilitates a streamlined analysis of investment
style at both the fund and the manager level. The effectiveness and usability of the system are demonstrated through domain
expert interviews and case studies by using a real mutual fund dataset.},
